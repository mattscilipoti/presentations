# Developing On Docker

## What is Docker?

- Docker is the world's leading software containerization platform.
  - a set of tools.  
  - An ecosystem around Containerization.  
  - Is also a shift in philosophy.

## What is Docker?
- Essentially virtualization: hosting an Operating System on another Operating System.
  - You can create **many lightweight Linux** virtual servers on your MBP.
- As developers, we will use them to **serve things we depend on** postgres, redis, SOLR, ELK, logstash, etc.  
- **That's just the start**.  As we'll see, they open up a whole new world of possibilities.

Docker allows you to package your application into a standardized unit for software development.

## What is Containerization?

Docker containers are lightweight, based on open standards, and secure by default.

Containers running on a single machine share the same operating system kernel;
- they start instantly and use less RAM.
- They have isolated filesystems and can share common files, making disk usage and image downloads much more efficient.

_Clarification:_ these are not, technically, virtual machines.  Containers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits -- but a different architectural approach allows containers to be more portable and efficient.  

In the end, for us, they both provide a server to run our stuff in isolation.
